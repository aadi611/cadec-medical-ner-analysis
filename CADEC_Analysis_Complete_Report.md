## Task Descriptions

### Task 1: Entity Enumeration
- **Purpose**: Count distinct entities for each label type (ADR, Drug, Disease, Symptom)
- **Output**: `./entity_lists/` - Text files with enumerated entities
- **Method**: Parse all annotation files and extract unique entities

### Task 2: LLM-based BIO Tagging
- **Purpose**: Use Hugging Face models for medical NER in BIO format
- **Output**: `./predictions/` - BIO tagged files and annotations
- **Method**: Medical NER pipeline + BIO tagging + format conversion

### Task 3: Performance Evaluation
- **Purpose**: Evaluate NER predictions against ground truth
- **Method**: Overlap-based evaluation (50% IoU threshold)
- **Justification**: More realistic than exact match for medical text
- **Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1-score per entity type

### Task 4: ADR-specific Evaluation (MedDRA)
- **Purpose**: Evaluate ADR detection using MedDRA ground truth
- **Output**: `./task4_predictions/` - ADR-focused predictions
- **Difference**: Uses MedDRA annotations instead of original annotations

### Task 5: Batch Evaluation (50 Random Files)
- **Purpose**: Measure performance across diverse forum posts
- **Output**: `./task5_results/` - Comprehensive statistics and CSV results
- **Method**: Same as Task 3, applied to 50 randomly selected files
- **Insights**: Performance variance and model limitations across dataset

### Task 6: SNOMED Code Matching
- **Purpose**: Match ADR predictions to SNOMED CT codes
- **Output**: `./task6_results/` - JSON results with code mappings
- **Methods**:
  - **String Matching**: Approximate text similarity
  - **Embedding Matching**: Semantic similarity using sentence transformers
- **Comparison**: Analyzes effectiveness of both approaches

## Key Findings

### Model Performance
- **Strengths**: Drug detection, high precision when confident
- **Weaknesses**: ADR recall, conservative predictions
- **Variability**: High performance variance across different forum posts

### Evaluation Insights
- **Overlap-based evaluation** more realistic than exact match
- **MedDRA annotations** provide more comprehensive ADR ground truth
- **String vs Embedding matching** each has unique advantages

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Entity Distribution**: Varied across different drug forum posts
- **Text Complexity**: Informal medical language presents challenges
- **Annotation Quality**: Multiple annotation sources provide rich ground truth

## Recommendations

### For Model Improvement
1. **Focus on ADR detection** - lowest performing entity type
2. **Address class imbalance** - more training data for underrepresented entities
3. **Fine-tune on medical forum text** - improve domain adaptation

### For Evaluation Enhancement
1. **Expand to more files** - current evaluation on subset of dataset
2. **Cross-validation** - ensure results generalize across different forum posts
3. **Expert validation** - medical professionals review model outputs

### For Clinical Application
1. **Active learning** - identify challenging cases for additional annotation
2. **Confidence thresholding** - use model confidence scores for deployment
3. **Human-in-the-loop** - combine automated detection with expert review

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Prerequisites
- CADEC dataset must be extracted to `./cadec/` directory
- Required Python packages: torch, transformers, pandas, numpy, sklearn
- Optional: sentence-transformers for Task 6 embedding matching

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Data Loading**: Parse annotation files in multiple formats
2. **Model Inference**: Use pre-trained medical NER models
3. **Evaluation**: Overlap-based metrics for realistic assessment
4. **Code Mapping**: Link predictions to standardized medical codes

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Usage**: Large transformer models require significant RAM
- **Processing Time**: Batch processing recommended for large datasets
- **Model Selection**: Medical-specific models preferred over general NER

## Future Work

### Short-term Improvements
- Experiment with different medical NER models
- Tune overlap thresholds for evaluation
- Add more sophisticated text preprocessing

### Long-term Research Directions
- Multi-modal analysis (combining text with structured data)
- Temporal analysis of adverse drug reactions
- Integration with clinical decision support systems
- Federated learning across multiple medical institutions

## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis of the CADEC dataset demonstrates both the potential and challenges of automated medical NER. The overlap-based evaluation methodology provides realistic performance estimates, while the comparison of string and embedding-based code matching offers insights into different semantic similarity approaches.

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Medical NER requires domain-specific evaluation methodologies
2. Multiple annotation sources (original, MedDRA, SNOMED) provide complementary perspectives
3. Performance varies significantly across different types of forum posts
4. Both string and embedding matching have unique strengths for code assignment

The complete pipeline from entity extraction to standardized code mapping provides a foundation for clinical applications while highlighting areas for continued research and development.
